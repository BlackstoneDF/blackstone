# This file represents a frontend for the Blackstone language.
# It defines how certain DiamondFire code blocks are called.
#
# Syntax requirements:
# <calling> = <block> <command> <arguments seen in item lore>
#
# So, this means that in: `PlayerAction.SendMessage = PlayerAction SendMessage Text(s)`
# PlayerAction.SendMessage is how you call the block from the language
# PlayerAction is the block you call.
# SendMessage is the action on the block.
# Text(s) is the argument. You can add another space after for another argument.
#
# Do note this syntax is not finalized.
# I wouldn't recommend adding to this until it's finalized.
PlayerAction.SendMessage = PlayerAction SendMessage Text(s)
